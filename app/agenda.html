                                            <p>We are very excited about the Global 15 Product Partner Day!
                                                Global 15 will have one full day devoted to product partners, pipeline, opportunity and focused cross-sell discussions.</p>
                                            <p>Leadership from several product groups will deliver strategic product speeches in two sessions (morning and afternoon).
                                                The speakers who are currently confirmed are Mike Niedermeyer, Sara Wardell-Smith, George Doolittle, Chris Lewis and possibly others to come.</p>

                                            <p>The Product Partner day will also include four deep-dive breakout sessions (one-hour each) with varying Product Partners pre-determined by GFI Area Heads.
                                                These breakouts will consist of smaller regional groups to allow for more concentrated time to effectively discuss your pipeline and opportunities.
                                                Our aim is that everyone walks away with a clear action plan and next steps for closing deals, clearing any hurdles and acquiring new business in 2015.
                                                We will provide each of the RMs and product partners with a pipeline one-pager containing their respective pipeline entries for each of the product breakout groups.
                                                Notifications will be sent to the relationship teams prior to pulling the pipeline reports in early January. <strong>It is important the Salesforce pipeline entries remain current.</strong>
                                                We will post the breakout grid that denotes the rotational order and schedule for the day, once it is finalized in the coming weeks.</p>
                                            <p>As we did in G13, we will also host a Product Expo, which will serve as the closing component on the evening of our Product Partner Day.
                                                Representatives from a variety of product groups across Wells Fargo will be in attendance to discuss client opportunities and provide product information.
