                                        <p>During Global 15, you will be offered eight learning and development courses that focus on a variety of topics,
                                            including both hard and soft skills, in the area of professional development.</p>
                                        <p>A total of six hours of learning and development sessions will be held: four hours on Monday and two hours on Wednesday.
                                            <strong>All attending GFI team members will be required to partake in the six sessions.</strong>
                                            Product partners and other attendees are also welcome to attend.</p>
                                        <p>Attendees will be able to choose their preferred courses. There will be no mandatory sessions during G15.
                                            We will provide program descriptions of each of the learning and development sessions shortly,
                                            so please visit this space for more information.</p>

                                        <p> We are very excited about the Global 15 Product Partner Day!
                                            Global 15 will have one full day devoted to product partners, pipeline, opportunity and focused cross-sell discussions.</p>
                                        <p>Leadership from several product groups will deliver strategic product speeches in two sessions (morning and afternoon).
                                            The speakers who are currently confirmed are Mike Niedermeyer, Sara Wardell-Smith, George Doolittle, Chris Lewis and possibly others to come.
                                            If you would like to submit questions, either written or video, please send them to <a href="mailto:GFI@wellsfargo.com">GFI@wellsfargo.com</a></p>
                                        <p>The Product Partner day will also include four deep-dive breakout sessions (one-hour each) with varying Product Partners pre-determined by GFI Area Heads.
                                            These breakouts will consist of smaller regional groups to allow for more concentrated time to effectively discuss your pipeline and opportunities.
                                            Materials will be supplied for you to help facilitate these discussions.
                                            We will post the breakout grid that denotes the rotational order and schedule for the day, once it is finalized in the coming weeks.</p>
                                        <p>As we did in G13, we will also host a Product Expo, which will serve as the closing component on the evening of our Product Partner Day.
                                            Representatives from a variety of product groups across Wells Fargo will be in attendance to discuss client opportunities and provide product information.
                                            The G15 Expo theme is <strong>&ldquo;Go for Gold.&rdquo;</strong>
                                            Please take the opportunity to join us so you can mix and mingle with your Product Partners during the Product Expo.</p>
